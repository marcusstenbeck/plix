**Plix is (going to be) a HTML5 game engine.** I'm creating it to explore game engine architecture, and what it really takes to make a game from scratch. There's no one particular type of game in mind, other than that the game should have real-time graphics, i.e. the graphics are rendered continuously instead of whenever an event occurs.


## Goal

Create a complete multiplayer Pong game with WebGL-powered graphics.
